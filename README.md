# chrome-click-extract
This is a Chrome extension that lets you scrape the information and display them inside a Datatables table on a server running on localhost.

Currently, the scraping is based on classes, but I will make further improvements to handle other types of selectors as well.

The localhost server allows you to download the data in JSON or CSV format too.
